  ## Generators
  The main generator used in the evacuation point is coal fed. You are able to insert coal into the generator to feed it - however it doesn't stop here.

  ## Details

  Upon clicking the generator with an empty hand, you can access the generator control panel. This shows you a multitude of details, however you mainly only need to focus on the [color=#a4885c]Throttle[/color], [color=#a4885c]Fuel Left[/color], [color=#a4885c]Fuel Use[/color] and the [color=#a4885c]Power Output[/color]

  The [color=#a4885c]Throttle[/color] is a slider which allows you to control how much power you wish for the generator to output.

  [color=#a4885c]Fuel Left[/color] displays how many units worth of fuel do you have left, while the [color=#a4885c]Fuel Usage[/color] shows how much time is left until a new piece of fuel is used.

  Finally, the [color=#a4885c]Power Output[/color] shows how much power is being outputted by the generators.
