# Frigid

Welcome to [color=#a4885c]Frigid[/color], a fork of SS14 set in a sci-fi universe where the world has ended and there's nothing we can do about it.

The government is evacuating civilians through evacuation points around the country to a heavily defended base, to "save" people from the horrors of bandits and other monsters.

## What This Is
Frigid is a roleplay-oriented fork of Space Station 14, oriented around PvE wave defense and survival in a cold world.

## Where to start
It's recommended to start with the [color=#a4885c]Survival[/color] guide, as that will explain how to survive this harsh universe. The [color=#a4885c]Monster[/color] guide is very helpful if you need to know what you're killing or what's killing you.

## Lore
A brief explanation of the lore (from a survivor's perspective) is simply that a bioengineered virus turned people feral, the world suddenly turned cold, monsters were everywhere and the government was evacuating people.

Of course there's more than that, but you'll have to find out what that more is, good luck!
